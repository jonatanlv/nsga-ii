# nsga-ii

This is an implementation of the *NSGA-II* algorithm in python.

Several well known tests problems are used to assess performance.

It has the following features:

* Can plot partial solutions at different intervals
* Keep a log of executions with some measures of performance
* Some mutators have been implemented
* Some replacers have been implemented
* Some crossovers have been implemented

# Improvements to be made (coming soon)

1. Speed, the principal issue is speed and some things can (must) be done about it.
2. Documentation is also an issue, it has to be created.
3. There is a memory of experiments, that could be published too (as part of the documentation, of course).
4. The tests were only made with real representations, binary representations were not explored deeply.
5. A lot of things I can't think of right now (but will become very cool improvements ;) ).
